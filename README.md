# KIF1C-bioID-visualization
An interactive visualization of KIF1C bioID data from 2019 Kendrick et al., https://doi.org/10.1083/jcb.201812170

This is a R Shiny project that generates a interactive scatter plot using published KIF1C bioID data (2019 Kendrick et al.). The plot allows (1) visualization of gene names when hovering over dots in the graph, and (2) highlighting the position of genes that are searched by the user.
